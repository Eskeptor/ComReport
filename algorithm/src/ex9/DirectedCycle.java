/* The DirectedCycle class represents a data type for determining whether a digraph has a directed 
 * cycle. The hasCycle operation determines whether the digraph has a directed cycle and, and of so, 
 * the cycle operation returns one.
 * This implementation uses depth-first search. The constructor takes time proportional to V+E
 * (in the worst case),  where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Afterwards, 
 * the hasCycle operation takes constant time;  the cycle operation takes time proportional to the length 
 * of the cycle. See Topological to compute a topological order if the digraph is acyclic. */
